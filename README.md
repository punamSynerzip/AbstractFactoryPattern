# AbstractFactoryPattern

Problem: 
	When we want to develop a system having related or dependent objects. 

Solution: 
	Abstract Factory design pattern is the best solution.

We just need to define an interface or an abstract class for creating families of related or dependent object without specifying their subclasses.

Advantage: 
	Can easily exchange the related objects.
